      - role: Technical Architect
        time: September 2016 - Present
        company: Broadridge, Cluj-Napoca
        details: |
           I joined Ullink, a French company later acquired by the renowned Broadridge, as a Java software developer in 2016.
           By 2021, I advanced to the role of Technical Architect for a low-latency, distributed pre-trade risk management solution. 
           My responsibilities include
            - designing and implementing low latency algorithms for processing high volumes of data that requires real-time risk assessment
            - improving performance and memory consumption
            - optimizing client/server interactions
      - role: Software Engineer Contractor
        time: June 2022 - March 2023
        company: Coder, Texas
        details: |
          This oportunity allowed me to dive into Jetbrains' new project at the time - Gateway, a single entry point to all development environments.
          I was tasked with developing a Gateway plugin to seamlessly integrate Coder workspaces in all JetBrains IDEs.
          Some of my responsabilities and work included:
            - designing & developing the new Gateway plugin
            - collaborating with the Coder team to incorporate necessary features into the plugin
            - working with the Jetbrains Gateway team to identify and resolve issues on the Gateway side

      - role: Software Engineer Contractor
        time: November 2020 - March 2021
        company: Coder, Texas
        details: |
          This experience was a short‑term contract role to automate, implement and improve Projector,
          which is an open source, client/server solution from JetBrains to run JetBrains IDEs remotely over
          the network. During my role within Coder I've worked on:
            - improve and stabilize Projector 
            - automate and streamline the deployment of Projector to Docker
            - improve the in‑house discovery mechanism of installed JetBrains IDEs

          Some of my work was upstreamed to JetBrains Projector:

            - https://github.com/JetBrains/projector‑server/pull/15
            - https://github.com/JetBrains/projector‑client/pull/13
      - role: Cofounder at Medware Labs
        time: November 2017 - 2024
        company: Medware Labs, Cluj-Napoca
        details: |
          In 2017, I co-founded a small medical software company with three friends.
          Since then, I have designed and implemented two Android apps specifically for surgeons and orthopedic doctors to prevent thrombosis (a blood clot that forms within a vein).
          The apps are targeted at a niche group of doctors and are intended to streamline and simplify the official guidelines and protocols required by the Romanian Government and Health Ministry. 
          Initially, we experimented with a revenue model where pharmaceutical companies could advertise their drugs through our apps when the protocols recommended a generic drug. 
          Our efforts included cold calls which initially provided some revenue. However, over time, our lack of marketing skills and drive to continue the sales effort became apparent. Revenue declined, and we are now primarily focused on fixing bugs.
