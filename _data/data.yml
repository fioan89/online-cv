          This oportunity allowed me to dive into Jetbrains' new project at the time - Gateway, a single entry point to all development environments.
          I was tasked with developin a Gateway plugin to seamlessly integrate Coder workspaces in all JetBrains IDEs.
          Some of my responsabilities and work included:
            - designing & developing the new Gateway plugin
            - collaborating with the Coder team to incorporate necessary features into the plugin
